// Triggered every few minutes by an external scheduler (see
// .github/workflows/warm-cache.yml — Vercel's own Cron is limited to once a
// day on the Hobby plan, which is nowhere near frequent enough to keep these
// caches warm) so a real visitor's request almost always reads an
// already-computed result instead of triggering the live computation.
// Optionally protected by CRON_SECRET, same convention as api/cron/daily-brief.
//
// Every cache warmed here now shares one site-wide ~5-minute freshness
// standard (see FUNDAMENTALS_TTL_MS in lib/data/index.ts for the fuller
// reasoning) and this cron itself runs on that same ~5-minute cadence, so
// warming each of them here means a real visitor almost never pays a live
// cold-computation cost even though every one of these now expires quickly:
// - the batched market-quote maps and technical-signal screen (search/
//   highlights/homepage movers)
// - the "整個市場一次回傳" whole-market datasets behind per-symbol
//   fundamentals/chips/earnings/announcements lookups — warmed via one
//   representative TW symbol (2330) each, since the underlying cache key is
//   the whole merged TWSE+TPEx map, not per-symbol
// - the daily brief, action brief, and news feed (all AI-touching)

// Fundamentals/chips/earnings/announcements are cached as one whole-market
// map per category (see lib/data/index.ts), not per symbol — asking for any
// single real TW symbol's data is enough to warm that entire map for every
// other symbol's lookups too. 2330 is always listed on TWSE, so it's a safe
// constant to warm with regardless of TPEx upstream health.
